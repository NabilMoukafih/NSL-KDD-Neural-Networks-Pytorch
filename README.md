NSL-KDD-Neural-Networks-Python

Short description: In this project, I was interested in identifying techniques to combine simple feedforward neural networks, as weak learners, and produces high detection capability with low computation resources. The model used the NSL-KDD dataset and the implementation was done in Python using the Pytorch library.
